# ESP32 Interface

**Description**: This app is meant to be an easy way to interact with an ESP32 device. It communicates through Bluetooth, some of the features include: getting and graphing data from altimeters and IMUs, controlling buzzers and individual pins, and controlling servo positions through sliders or your phone's orientation.

**How did you build this**: I used Swift UI to build the app. First I looked at other bluetooth ios apps to get started on my own bluetooth feature, and then used online resources for any problems I encountered such as graphing data. 

**How many hours did you spend on this**: 70 hours
