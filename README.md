# ESP32 Interface
An easy way to interact with an ESP32 device. It communicates through Bluetooth, and you can do things such as write servo values, get sensor data, and read serial data.

All the other apps on the app store related to the ESP32 either are for IOTs and require accounts, or they are very specific, such as reading/writing to serial. My app is more general purpose, and is meant to be a simple way for users to make their ESP32 do whatever they want without needing an account.
